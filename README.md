# Experimental Docker Image for Springboard DSC Students

## Status: Untested on all notebooks

Available on Docker Hub: [https://hub.docker.com/r/frankfletcher/sb-dsc](https://hub.docker.com/r/frankfletcher/sb-dsc)

## Quick Start Instructions

1. Make sure you have Docker installed. We highly suggest installing [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Make a  subdirectory of your home directory and called `~/SPRINGBOARD_FILES`.  This is where you will add your schoolwork git repos.
3. Clone this repo to your local machine
4. Go to the local repo in your terminal and type `docker compose up`. If this is your first time, it will have to pull the image from docker hub and it'll take some time to set up.
5. There will be 2 links near the bottom of the page. Use those links to start your web browser and connect to Jupyter lab.
   1. Assuming that it installed, you can also just click on this link: [(http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab)](http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab)
